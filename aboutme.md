Hey, I’m Matt and I'm a junior studying Mechanical Engineering at Cornell University, and I am looking for a internship/job in engineering design. I have previous experience working at DuPont as an Engineering Intern managing the HVAC on site. On campus, I am the Co-Founder and Mechanical Subteam Lead of the CSalt Project Team, and I was the Drivetrain & Steering Subteam Lead for the Cornell University Solar Boat Project Team.

One project I have done in a class is creating an umbrella for _MAE 2250: Introduction to Mechanical Design_. This process involved interveiwing potential users at my university about their needs and issues they have surrounding using an umbrella during rainy weather, as a large percentage of people refuse to use them. My team and I took the feedback into account and developed a collection of ideas of different solutions to various issues such as weight, sturdiness, and splashing. Once this was done, our team narrowed the pool to three of our best concepts, and created preliminary prototypes for each. We then decided on our favorite one and spent a semester iterating on this design through several prototypes and CAD models in Fusion 360. In our final design, we made sure to focus on the ease of manufacturability, stability, and opening and closing the umbrella quickly.
